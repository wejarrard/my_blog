I just received a masters in data science seeking a full-time position in data science or machine learning engineering. I am experienced contributor in the biotech industry working on infrastructure projects and predictive models such as a two year project of helping a hospital in Rwanda digitize their medical records. I have experience in statistical analysis, machine learning and deep learning with tools including Pandas/Spark/Pytorch/Tensorflow in Python, tidyverse in R, and SQL. I am interested in pursuing projects and expanding my knowledge in these fields by contributing on a team thats working on interesting problems.
